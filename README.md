Small game made, using Phaser 3, with the objective being catch all the garbage , and take it to the surface, while avoiding predator animals,
and collide with the cavern walls.

I only programmed the game,  and created the level using tilemaps.   However all credits for who created each asset:

Future Updates: 

Create at least 1-2 more levels
Remove the falling garbage 
planting the water bottles more randomly
change the score system (maybe add by each bottle and a bonus, from the time left, when the player finishes the level)
